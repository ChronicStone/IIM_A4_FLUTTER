# TaskList Flutter

A simple Todo List app made with Flutter (& NestJs/Mongodb for API).

## How to run the app 

#### 1. Install & run API dev server

```sh
cd api
```

Start by going to the API folder, and createa .env file from the .env.dist present on the repo.
Note that to run the API, you need a running mongodb instance. If you need to change username, host ..., edit the DATABASE_URL env. var on the .env

Now you can run the API server :

```sh
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

App should now be running on port 3000. Open http://localhost:3000 on your browser. If you see "Hello world", then you're good to go.

This is a standard flutter app, run the dev server using `flutter run`
